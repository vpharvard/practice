# Practice

This Practice set will test your understanding of mustache templates in express and components in Angular.  You will be tasked to understand nested templates and convert them into nested angular components.  You will also be required to show that you understand how to use the Angular CLI tool.

This repository contains a simple app that uses express.js and mustache templates to render nested components.  Use the Angular CLI to recreate this application with nested components using Angular.  Your solution should contain a parent component, and two nested components (one nested within the other).
